# Octave Builder

[![Build Octave](https://github.com/jgoldfar/octave-builder/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgoldfar/octave-builder/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository exists to provide a transparent, reproducible build for [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), particularly on MacOS.
Octave is a free mathematical programming environment with a syntax nearly identical to that of MATLAB.

For more information on Octave, see the Octave web site,
[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

The build is automated using Github Actions - see [`.github/workflows`](./.github/workflows) for details.
