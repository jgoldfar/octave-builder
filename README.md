# Octave Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/octave-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/octave-builder)

This repository exists to provide a transparent and somewhat reproducible build for [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), particularly on MacOS.
Octave is a free mathematical programming environment with a syntax nearly identical to that of MATLAB.

For more information on Octave, see the Octave web site,
